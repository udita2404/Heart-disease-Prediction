# Heart Disease Prediction ðŸ«€

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical and lifestyle data.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The notebook:
- Loads and preprocesses data
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Trains classification models
- Evaluates performance using accuracy and other metrics

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
